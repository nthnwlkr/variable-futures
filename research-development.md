benefits: 
- Loading times: "Having to download a font from the server that is not on your device takes time, especially if there are a number of different typographic font styles loading all at the same time on a single page. Variable fonts allow the data necessary for theoretically infinite font variations to be stored in one file. This allows for fewer font files with an increased level of variability in less time."
- Low Light Adaptability: "Variable fonts provide the designer with the ability to allow for changes in light intensity. For example, for users moving between high and low light areas, variable fonts can react by adjusting selected axes such as stroke contrast or optical sizing to give the user the best reading experience possible for that particular environment."
- Responsive Potential: "Web typography is no longer restricted to an anchored CSS framework. Responsive layouts now have the chance to level up and incorporate creative typographic detailing unseen on the web until now. Layouts are no longer restricted to a small range of master fonts, defined by the typography designer."
- Distance Awareness: "Variable fonts also have the potential for user distance awareness adjustments. Devices with the correct hardware (proximity sensors) are able to adjust key variable font axes such as weight and width to allow the user an increased level of legibility from a distance further away from their device."
- Self iterating design: "Variable fonts also open the potential for intelligent websites that self iterate and make typographic and layout adjustments based on individual users. A selection of metrics could be used by the website to rapidly test potential improvements to the page over a period of time. These results could then be implemented by the website to give optimised individual experiences."
- Creative Freedom: "Theoretically, variable fonts give designers an infinite number of possible variations. They allow designers a level of typographic freedom in both traditional print and digital based mediums unseen before. They allow for detail adjustments such as slightly condensing the width of a typeface for narrow columns or subtly tweaking the weight of a thin typeface when used on a black background."
- Sound Sensitive Type: "More creative avenues are now in reach as well. Subtle or bold adjustments can be used in conjunction with sound as a creative tool. This could be as subtle as small changes in an axis used with sound for micro-animations in a mobile UI (User interface), or for much bolder uses such as creative axes adjustments in performance arts and set design."
- Screen Resolution: "Type on low resolution screens appears differently than it does on a higher resolution device. The smaller the type size, the fewer details are noticeable by the viewer. On these lower resolution devices designers will still be able to maintain legibility. Variable fonts with optical size axes adjustments will be able  to counter legibility with an increase in optical size."
